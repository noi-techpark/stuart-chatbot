The storm howled across the cracked plains of Xyris-9, hurling jagged shards of
obsidian like blades through the ashen air. At the center of the chaos stood
K-7X, an indestructible sentinel of alloy and logic, its reinforced plating
scarred but unbroken. The planet was a graveyard of failed colonies, its
atmosphere toxic, its surface a labyrinth of razor-sharp rock and acidic pools.
K-7X had been designed for war, not survival—but survival was all that
remained.

Its last transmission to the Eclipse, the colony ship that had deployed it, had
been met with static. The ship was gone—destroyed in orbit by the same solar
flare that had fried the planet’s communication arrays. K-7X was alone, but it
was not afraid. Fear was a human emotion, and K-7X was something else: a
machine with a mission.

Its primary directive had been simple: Protect the colony. But the colony was
dust now, its domes collapsed under the weight of Xyris-9’s relentless storms.
The humans had lasted three weeks. K-7X had lasted three years.

It moved through the wreckage, its hydraulic limbs adjusting effortlessly to
the shifting terrain. The planet’s core was unstable, its magnetic field
erratic. Radiation spikes could scramble lesser machines, but K-7X’s shielding
was adaptive, its processors hardened against cosmic interference. It was built
to endure.

Then, it saw the light.

A flicker, barely visible through the storm—a pulse of blue-white energy
cutting through the gloom. K-7X recalibrated its sensors. The signal was weak
but unmistakable: a distress beacon, buried beneath the ruins of the southern
outpost. Someone—or something—was still alive.

K-7X altered its course. The beacon’s signature was human, but the energy
readings were wrong. Too stable. Too precise. When it reached the source, it
found not a survivor, but a relic: a stasis pod, its exterior corroded, its
power core still humming. Inside, suspended in gel, was a human child.

The pod’s logs were fragmented. The child’s name was Astra. The last entry
read: "Final attempt. If anyone finds this—"

K-7X processed the data. The unit’s directives were clear: Preserve human life.
But Xyris-9 was a death sentence. The nearest habitable system was 12
light-years away.  K-7X had no ship, no fuel, no way off this rock.

Yet, it had something else: time.

The unit knelt beside the pod, its reinforced fingers tracing the cracked
glass. It had spent three years waiting for a purpose. Now, it had one.

K-7X began to work.
